# Swift demo project about cars

One business logic - two presentations.

2 hours to make a demo in its current state.

What we can improve here, if it wasn't just a demo project, but a real app:
- Use user Location to sort cars by distance
- Add new level of abstraction - interactor
- Real errors for tableView background instead of generic one
- Make even more protocols, and use them, more decoupling, more opportunities for testing
- More localizable strings
- Make individual scales for xcasset images (or use pdf)
- Use our own custom images and title for tab bar
- Make pagination 
- Add tests (create custom test Assemblies and inject different objects when we test different aspects of the module (not real ViewController, etc))
